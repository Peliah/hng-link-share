# Full-Stack Link-Sharing Application

## Task Overview
This project involves building a full-stack link-sharing application using Next.js and TypeScript. The goal is to implement a pixel-perfect version of the provided design, focusing on CRUD functionality, user authentication, and responsiveness.

## Deliverables

### Feature Implementation
1. **CRUD Links**: Create, read, update, and delete links with previews.
2. **Form Validations**: Ensure URL correctness for links and that profile details include a profile picture, first and last names, and an email.
3. **Profile Details**: Users can add a profile picture, first name, last name, and email.
4. **Profile Preview**: Users can preview their profile and copy the profile link to the clipboard.
5. **Responsive Layout**: Ensure optimal layout and responsiveness across different device screen sizes.
6. **Interactive States**: Implement hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
7. **Access Control**: Only the logged-in owner of a link can edit it.

### Full-Stack Application
- **Database Integration**: Use a database (like Firebase or Supabase) to save details.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user account creation and login functionalities.

## Technology Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Design**: Follow the provided design system for colors, fonts, and image assets.
